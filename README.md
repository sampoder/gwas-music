A little Next.js website to allow anyone to add songs to a Spotify playlist.

**Want to make your own?**

Epic! Fork this repo, change up the copy, deploy it to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and then set the below environmental variables.

`SPOTIFY_PLAYLIST` the ID of your Spotify Playlist.

`SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`, available in your Spotify API dashboard.

`SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`, available in your Spotify API dashboard.

`SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN` a weird quirk of Spotify's auth system. Use [this tool](https://github.com/spotify/web-api-auth-examples/tree/master/client_credentials) to get yours.
